Who developed it? What makes it to be different from other languages? What are the benefits of learning Java?\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nJava is a programming language that follows object-oriented programming paradigms. What are paradigms? In computer science, we have various programming paradigms. These are the styles of writing code, it\'s not a language. Some programming paradigms are Procedural, Functional, Object-Oriented, Event-Driven.\\n\\nAmong these most used paradigms are object-oriented and functional. Java was developed by James Gosling, in 1995, for Sun Microsystems which was further developed by \\" Oracle \\" in 2010. It was originally called \\" oke \\" after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling\'s office. Later it was renamed to \\" green \\" and again it was changed to \\"Java \\" inspired by java coffee. Java is very popular and widely used in the industry because Java is an independent programming language that follows the logic \u201c Write once, run anywhere \u201d. This means that the compiled code can run on all platforms which support java.\\n\\nJava is an object-oriented programming language. In java, everything is considered to be an \u201cobject\u201d and all the operations are performed using these objects. Java program can be executed on any kind of machine containing any CPU or operating system.\\n\\nJava allows us to write a program that can do many things simultaneously. Java has a garbage collector in the Java-Runtime environment where the memory will be deallocated when the program exits from the method."},{"id":"simple-linear-regression","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/simple-linear-regression","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2020-05-05-simple-linear-regression/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-05-05-simple-linear-regression/index.md","title":"Simple Linear Regression","description":"Linear regression is the simplest form of a classification problem.

Y = m \\\\* x + C, Where Y , x = point on the line, m = slope , C = Y intercept. So, from the above equation we can create a line just by finding the optimal values of m,C.\\n\\nSo we create a neural network and initialize it with random weights and biases.These represent the m,C of the line.\\n\\nIn the above illustration it is clearly evident that the m,C are not able to help us classify the data correctly. So, any prediction deduced from the network is going to be wrong. Now, we have to train the network to get the optimal values of the m,C (weights and bias).\\n\\nWhile training networks for simple regression problems we need not worry much about over-fitting in most of the cases ,but if the number of epochs are not enough then the model might under-fit. In most of the cases 100\u2013200 epochs are more than enough."},{"id":"simple-cnn-using-pytorch","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/simple-cnn-using-pytorch","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2020-05-01-simple-cnn-using-pytorch/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-05-01-simple-cnn-using-pytorch/index.md","title":"Simple CNN using PyTorch","description":"This article is a simple guide that will help you build and understand the concepts behind building a simple CNN.

A CNN works very similar to how our human eye works. The core operations that are behind the CNN\u2019s are matrix additions and multiplications.So, there is no need to get worried about them.\\n\\nBut to know about the working of the CNN\u2019s we need to know how the image gets stored in the computer. The core function behind a CNN is the convolution operation. It is multiplication of the image matrix with a filter matrix to extract some important features from the image matrix.\\n\\nAnother important component of a CNN is called the Max-pool layer. This helps us in reducing the number of features i.e. it sharpens them so that our CNN performs better.\\n\\nSo now you are aware of the layers we are going to use. This knowledge is enough for building a simple CNN but one optional layer call the dropout will help the CNN perform well. Dropout layer is placed in between the fc layers and this randomly drops the connection with a set probability which will help us in training the CNN better."}]}}')}}]);
